## What does this project contain?
This repository contains the data, code, and results of an analysis of horror movie ratings of horror movies that were released between the years of 2012 and 2017 (horror movies include theatrical, television, and ancillary market releases). The motivation is simply an interest in horror movies and wondering whether there are any factors that give a good indication that a horror movie will be reviewed better than others!

## What is the source data?
This analysis is based derived from IMDB first put on Kaggle and then hosted on https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday, which is where I sourced the data from. The data contains information on 3,328 different horror movies. Examples of included properties are genre(s), release data, release country, MPAA rating, and movie run time (in minutes). The data consists of 12 columns, 11 of which pertain to the movie properties, and the remaining 1 column peratins to what I considered the outcome in my analysis - the review rating (which ranged from 1 to 10).

If you wish to replicate this exact analysis, please utilize the csvs located in the source_data folder of this repository.
